## NMFC Governance & Strategy – v1.5
**Date:** May 23, 2025  
**Maintainer:** Travis Price

### Description
This update refines the Year 1 assumptions around firewood supply, cost modeling, and startup capital. It reflects the confirmed operating conditions for NMFC’s initial year, including the founder-only compensation model and a leaner launch footprint. The updates aim to maintain clarity, reduce overestimation of supply costs, and reinforce the sustainability of NMFC’s mission-driven model.

### Added
- Formal Year 1 startup capital summary with updated totals
- Explicit NHI allocation of 3 cords per household

### Changed
- Firewood needs reduced from 200 cords to 125 cords total
- Updated firewood budget to $20,625
- Total Year 1 capital revised to $66,625
- Strategy Executive defined as unpaid (BTC bonus only)

### Notes
These changes further reduce upfront costs and align workload and compensation models. This version sets the final baseline for Year 1 performance review and reporting.
