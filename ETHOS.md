# NMFC ETHOS: Burn Bright. Stay Free.

Northern Michigan Firewood Company is not just a business. It's a declaration.

We believe in:
- **Sovereignty over dependency**
- **Mutual aid over charity**
- **Cultural stewardship over corporate scaling**
- **Hard work, honest pay, and antifragile living**

We reject:
- Token speculation
- Corporate extractions
- Greenwashing and performative social impact

We use Bitcoin not as hype—but as a long-term tool for sovereignty. We have no token, no DAO, and no shareholder class. We build for our region, our people, and our principles.

If you build something inspired by NMFC, do it with your community—not for a market.

Burn Bright. Stay Free.
