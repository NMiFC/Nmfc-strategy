# Why We’ve Stopped Naming Politicians

Northern Michigan Firewood Company (NMFC) was built out of frustration — a refusal to accept indifference, injustice, or institutional decay. Early on, our messaging included direct criticisms of specific public officials. That anger was real. It still is. But anger without strategy burns bridges instead of lighting torches.

## Our New Stance

To better serve our mission and expand the movement, we are no longer publicly calling out individual politicians by name — regardless of party, position, or behavior.

This isn’t about forgiveness.  
It’s about focus.

## Here’s Why:

### 1. **The System Is the Problem**  
We believe most failures of leadership are not personal — they are structural. Politicians who uphold harmful policies are often symptoms, not root causes. We aim higher.

### 2. **We’re Building a Bigger Tent**  
Our firewood kiosks, mutual aid programs, and cultural tools are for *everyone* — regardless of who they voted for. If we start with division, we lose people who might otherwise walk with us.

### 3. **Action > Outrage**  
Calling someone out might feel good. But building a community that doesn’t *need* them? That’s power. That’s movement-building.

### 4. **We Want to Be Unignorable — Not Unapproachable**  
We’re designing a system that works without political permission. We don’t need enemies. We need roots.

## What We Say Now

Instead of attacking names, we name systems:  
- **Extraction**  
- **Neglect**  
- **Gatekeeping**  
- **Surveillance capitalism**  
- **Energy monopolies**  
- **Abandonment**

Our work speaks for itself. Our warmth travels farther when the message stays open.

**We’re not calming down. We’re sharpening up.**  
Because this isn’t about them.  
It’s about *us*.
