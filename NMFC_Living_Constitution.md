_For Sovereignty, Solidarity, and the Long Memory_

We, the originators and stewards of Northern Michigan Firewood Company (NMFC), do not found this for profit alone, but for sovereignty, resilience, and the dignity of those forgotten by traditional power. We believe infrastructure can be just, and that commerce can be culture.

## To build a decentralized, regenerative, and culturally rooted enterprise that:
- Resists exploitative systems
- Strengthens local self-reliance

- Protects the vulnerable through action, not pity
