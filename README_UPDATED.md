# Northern Michigan Firewood Company (NMFC) Strategy

**A decentralized warmth economy rooted in sovereignty, mutual aid, and cultural infrastructure.**

This repository contains the strategic blueprint for NMFC — a movement disguised as a firewood business. We’re building a self-replicating system that rejects extraction, resists abandonment, and restores dignity through direct community care.

- Mutual aid is the new utility.

We’re not calming down — we’re focusing up.
