# Northern Michigan Firewood Company (NMFC)

**Burn Bright. Stay Free.**

This is the living story of NMFC — a kiosk-based firewood and community heat model designed to challenge extractive systems with warmth, Bitcoin reserves, and cooperative governance.

## A Letter to You

Some of you will understand what this is — and some of you won’t. That’s okay. Truly.

I’m not writing this because I want attention. I’m writing this because I’ve lived through chaos. I’ve made mistakes. I’ve lied, numbed, and coasted when I should’ve cared. And now I’m trying to put something out into the world that might make it better.

There’s a lot of fear in me, if I’m honest. Not fear of the work — I know how to work. Fear of what happens when you challenge a system that’s addicted to control, scarcity, and silence. When systems like that start starving, they fight.

This firewood model might seem simple. But it’s dangerous to those who extract, because it gives people a way out. It replaces debt with self-reliance. Burnout with stewardship. Profit hoarding with warmth.

I don’t want to be the center of this. I never will be. I’ll serve wherever this thing needs me — kiosk builder, council member, ditch digger — for as long as I’m needed, but no longer than that.

If you get it, you get it. And if you do — I will always need your help.

Because alone, we’re vulnerable. But together, we are power.

## Why It Matters

Most utopias are written by theorists.
This one was built with a truck, a kiosk, and a spreadsheet.

NMFC isn’t just a business plan — it’s a post-capitalist operating system. A blueprint for sovereign local power, antifragile economics, and mutual care.

If it spreads, it will do so not with noise — but with wood, warmth, and work.

This is not utopia. This is exit.
