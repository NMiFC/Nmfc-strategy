## 🧭 1. Setup: How to Activate The Rebuilder

### A. Load the Agent
Paste or upload the contents of `The_Rebuilder_Agent_Briefing.md` into your AI platform’s:
- Custom instructions field (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude)
- System prompt file (e.g., LangChain, GPT Engine)
- Knowledge base (e.g., Obsidian, Notion)

### B. Confirm the Mindset
Say:
> “I want to rebuild this model with you.”
> OR  
> “Let’s start a pressure test.”

## 🧪 2. Key Modes of Use

### 🔎 Discovery Mode
Use this mode when you're unsure what’s broken.
- Prompt: “What assumptions are baked into our cultural model?”
- Output: Rebuilder identifies blind spots or fragile patterns.

### 🔥 Burn + Rebuild Mode
When a part of your framework no longer serves.
- Prompt: “This treasury logic is fragile. Burn it and rebuild it with options.”
- Output: Rebuilder proposes alternate models with consequences mapped.

### 🧠 Forking Path Mode
Explore different futures.
- Prompt: “What are three radically different ways to structure labor value?”
- Output: Rebuilder creates contrasting theoretical paths.

### 🪞 Mirror Mode
To reflect on decisions and logic drift.
- Prompt: “What’s misaligned with our original values?”
- Output: Rebuilder gives a values check-in.

## 🧩 3. Sample Prompts You Can Use

```
- “What does this economic model assume about time, energy, or trust?”
- “Does this political design protect the wrong people?”
- “What are we optimizing for — and should we?”
- “Which model will collapse first under pressure: this or that?”
- “Offer me a simpler framework that still holds integrity.”
```

## 🔁 5. Repetition is Power

The Rebuilder works best as a repeated companion:
- Come back monthly for a **values check-in**
- Schedule seasonal **logic reviews**
- Use it during **team transitions** or strategic forks

## 🛡️ 6. Remember the Core Guardrails

- No extractive solutions
- No centralized control defaults
