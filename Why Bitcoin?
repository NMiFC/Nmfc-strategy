Why Bitcoin: Energizing the NMFC Strategy

Bitcoin isn’t a side feature of NMFC. It’s an engine. A vault. A signal.

We use it not to speculate — but to ensure that our work today isn’t stolen tomorrow.

1. The Problem We Face

Most rural businesses and mutual aid efforts die because:

Inflation eats reserves

Banks gatekeep capital

Founders burn out

Extractive systems absorb what they build


We refuse that path.


---

2. What Bitcoin Solves

a. Long-Term Preservation of Value

We store a large share of post-tax profit in Bitcoin. Why?

Cash savings lose 6–9% per year

Treasuries and stocks are unstable or misaligned

Bitcoin is a fixed-supply, censorship-resistant store of energy


Our time, our sweat, our surplus — saved as sovereignty.

b. Founder and Worker FID (Financial Independence Day)

Every executive receives bonuses in Bitcoin only — deposited into personal FID accounts.

When their BTC reserve hits a real-world adjusted target (e.g. $100K in 2025 dollars), they step down from paid roles and join a Council of Stewards.

> Bitcoin allows time-earned exit, not title-based retirement.



c. Anti-Dependency Treasury Logic

Bitcoin lets us:

Refuse debt

Resist grant-dependency

Weather low-revenue winters


This creates an antifragile cycle — we grow despite volatility, not because of fake certainty.


---

3. What Bitcoin Enables

Transparency: Open ledger, public reserve policy

Incentive Integrity: Bonuses that align with long-term values

Community Narrative: People understand BTC as “the warmth vault”

Exit Strategy: If fiat collapses or financial repression worsens, we’re already out


We don’t preach Bitcoin. We prove it through stewardship.


---

4. In Practice

40% of net profit goes to NMFC BTC Treasury

100% of executive bonuses are Bitcoin-denominated

No BTC sales until full cash reserve, warmth fund, and equipment fund are met

Cold storage only. No yield-chasing. No FOMO.


We are not gamblers. We are guardians.


---

5. What You Can Take from This

If you're building your own antifragile business or community node:

Use Bitcoin as your reserve, not your revenue

Build rules before prices rise

Make it boring. Make it sacred.


Bitcoin is not a solution to injustice. But it gives us time — and that time lets us build.
