## Weekly Time Commitment (Conservative Estimates)

| Role             | Weekly Hours | Core Duties |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Kiosk Steward (Worker) | 10–15 hrs/week | Firewood loading, refills, cleanliness, care delivery |
| Coordinator      | 15–20 hrs/week | Inventory, scheduling, community coordination |
| Executive (Ops/Strategy/Care) | 20–25 hrs/week | Governance, financial oversight, system design |

**Note:**  
- Physical work tapers off after Year 2 as automation and stability increase.  
- Transition to cooperative structure begins in Year 10, with reduced executive load.  
- All roles receive COLA (Cost of Living Adjustment) annually.
