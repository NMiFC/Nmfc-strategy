# Northern Michigan Firewood Company (NMFC)

**Burn Bright. Stay Free.**

This repository houses the full antifragile, culture-anchored strategy for the Northern Michigan Firewood Company—an unapologetically values-first firewood kiosk system rooted in sovereignty, mutual aid, and worker-led governance.

We reject extraction. We reject silence.  
We build systems that can’t be bought, because we know what they’re worth.

## Philosophy

We don’t wait to get rich before we give.  
We don’t ask permission to care for each other.  
We don’t follow markets—we build culture.

This is a punk-powered business plan. A community kiosk economy. A 20-year roadmap for post-collapse care infrastructure that runs on wood, trust, and firelight.
