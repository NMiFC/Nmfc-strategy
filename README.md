# Northern Michigan Firewood Company (NMFC) Strategy

**A decentralized warmth economy rooted in sovereignty, mutual aid, and cultural infrastructure.**

This repository contains the strategic blueprint for NMFC — a movement disguised as a firewood business. We’re building a self-replicating system that rejects extraction, resists abandonment, and restores dignity through direct community care.

## Our Ethos

We believe:

- Warmth is a human right.  
- Decentralized systems create real freedom.  
- Culture is infrastructure.  
- Mutual aid is the new utility.

We’re not calming down — we’re focusing up.

## Purpose

Northern Michigan Firewood Company is more than a business—it’s a values-driven system. We believe in local resilience, direct ownership, mutual aid, and financial independence. Our mission is to:

- Deliver high-quality, accessible firewood and community goods.
- Support rural culture through economic sovereignty.
- Operate transparently through a values-aligned cooperative model.
- Build long-term treasury resilience via dual-currency systems (cash + Bitcoin).

---

## Project Goals (Phase I: 2025–2026)

- Launch first kiosk with mural-based cultural branding.
- Develop full production and retail system for firewood and candles.
- Educate community through content, documentation, and public action.
- Build legal, accounting, and governance infrastructure for cooperative transition.
- Deploy profits into The Northern Warmth Initiative and a sovereign treasury model.

---

## Governance Model

### Key Principles
- **Financial Independence Day (FID):** A defined threshold where leaders step back from pay and shift to unpaid advisory roles.
- **Advisor & Steward Council:** A body of trusted former leaders with limited oversight powers rooted in values enforcement.
- **Cooperative Transition:** Operational control and surplus distribution shifts to members starting in Year 10.
- **Profit Allocation:** 20% to community programs, 15% to site hosts, 10% to cash reserves, 40% to Bitcoin reserves, and 15% to owner bonuses (held in BTC).

## Final Note (Excerpt)

> “Lead me, follow me, or get out of my way.” – Thomas Paine

This project is not a business in the traditional sense. It is a declaration of sovereignty, dignity, and resistance to commodified community. The weight of this work cannot be carried by one person—and it was never meant to be.

# 🌲 Northern Michigan Firewood Company: Why We Removed All Social Media (Except YouTube)

> Northern Michigan Firewood Company is building something real — not just scalable.  
> This repo explains why we’ve chosen to leave all social media platforms *except* YouTube.

---

## ✋ Our Commitment

We believe in:
- Sovereignty over surveillance,
- Depth over virality,
- Community over clout.

Social media platforms — especially those driven by advertising, algorithmic manipulation, and extractive attention cycles — do not serve our mission or our values. We've chosen a deliberate path: **no Facebook, no Instagram, no TikTok, no X, no LinkedIn.**

---

## ✅ Why We Kept YouTube

We kept **YouTube** for one reason:

> 🎥 **It allows us to tell stories that matter.**

YouTube is not perfect, but it gives us the ability to:
- Show our work, not just promote it
- Educate others about the kiosk model and cultural values behind it
- Archive our philosophy, projects, murals, and impact
- Build a public record, not just a feed

It is *long-form*, *searchable*, and *time-independent*.  
No other platform offers that.

---

## ❌ Why We Left the Rest

| Platform     | Why We Left |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Facebook/Instagram** | Centralized, ad-driven, high surveillance, poor community health |
| **X (Twitter)**        | Amplifies outrage, rewards reaction over reflection |
| **TikTok**             | Algorithmic manipulation, short-form dopamine loop |
| **LinkedIn**           | Performative, professionalized noise |
| **Threads**            | Meta-controlled echo chamber with little soul |

We didn’t leave out of burnout.  
We left out of **clarity**.

---

## 🔁 Our Replacement Strategy

Instead of chasing algorithms, we focus on:

- **In-person visibility**  
  Bold murals, branded kiosks, artist collabs, workshops

- **Local press & word-of-mouth**  
  Radio, newspaper, zines, school partnerships

- **Email and SMS**  
  Permission-based, direct communication with our community

- **This GitHub**  
  Transparent, public, and open-source documentation of our movement

---

## 🧠 This Is Bigger Than Us

This decision isn’t just about marketing.

It’s about resisting the pressure to turn every mission into a brand and every conversation into content.

We want to live and work **in reality** — not in the digital casino of borrowed attention.
