# Northern Michigan Firewood Company (NMFC) Strategy

**A decentralized warmth economy rooted in sovereignty, mutual aid, and cultural infrastructure.**

This repository contains the strategic blueprint for NMFC — a movement disguised as a firewood business. We’re building a self-replicating system that rejects extraction, resists abandonment, and restores dignity through direct community care.

## Our Ethos

- Decentralized systems create real freedom.  
- Culture is infrastructure.  
- Mutual aid is the new utility.

We’re not calming down — we’re focusing up.

## Purpose

Northern Michigan Firewood Company is more than a business—it’s a values-driven system. We believe in local resilience, direct ownership, mutual aid, and financial independence. Our mission is to:

- Deliver high-quality, accessible firewood and community goods.
- Support rural culture through economic sovereignty.
- Operate transparently through a values-aligned cooperative model.
- Build long-term treasury resilience via dual-currency systems (cash + Bitcoin).

---

## Project Goals (Phase I: 2025–2026)

- Launch first kiosk with mural-based cultural branding.
- Develop full production and retail system for firewood and candles.
- Educate community through content, documentation, and public action.
- Build legal, accounting, and governance infrastructure for cooperative transition.
- Deploy profits into The Northern Warmth Initiative and a sovereign treasury model.

## Governance Model

### Key Principles
- **Financial Independence Day (FID):** A defined threshold where leaders step back from pay and shift to unpaid advisory roles.
- **Advisor & Steward Council:** A body of trusted former leaders with limited oversight powers rooted in values enforcement.
- **Cooperative Transition:** Operational control and surplus distribution shifts to members starting in Year 10.
- **Profit Allocation:** 20% to community programs, 15% to site hosts, 10% to cash reserves, 40% to Bitcoin reserves, and 15% to owner bonuses (held in BTC).

## Final Note (Excerpt)

> “Lead me, follow me, or get out of my way.” – Thomas Paine

This project is not a business in the traditional sense. It is a declaration of sovereignty, dignity, and resistance to commodified community. The weight of this work cannot be carried by one person—and it was never meant to be.
