## Final Note: The Line Drawn

> “Lead me, follow me, or get out of my way.” – *Thomas Paine*

This project—**Northern Michigan Firewood Company**—is not a business in the traditional sense. It is a declaration. Of sovereignty. Of dignity. Of resistance to systems that commodify communities, strip meaning from labor, and profit off disconnection.

The initial planning phase is now complete. What comes next will require structure, legal grounding, and financial clarity. That means:

- **Contacting legal clinics** to ensure the cooperative and FID models are watertight.  
- **Reaching out to accounting clinics** to finalize treasury protocols, reserve caps, and Bitcoin-based forecasting.  
- **Engaging political offices and representatives** not to beg for support, but to inform them—clearly—what we’re building, and what it stands for.  
- **Educating those who find this work**—so they can understand the vision, question it honestly, and decide for themselves if they belong inside it.

This next phase is about translation: turning vision into law, code, capital, and coordination. But it cannot be done alone.

### One Person Cannot Carry This

No matter how clear the vision or how bold the roadmap, the weight of resilience must be distributed—or it will collapse. This is not a plea. It’s structural reality.

I will never ask anyone to join me. I will not persuade you of values. That is not leadership—it is sales.  
You join because **you see something worth building**.  
Because you’re **done waiting for permission**.  
Because you want **something different, and maybe better**.

If that’s you, the door is open.  
If not, I bear you no ill will. But I won’t carry you, and I won’t slow down.

### This is the line.  
### Let’s build something that **doesn’t flinch**.
