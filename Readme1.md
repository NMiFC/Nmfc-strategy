**A decentralized, community-rooted firewood business built on sovereignty, rural dignity, and constitutional accountability.**

## Purpose

Northern Michigan Firewood Company is more than a business—it’s a values-driven system. We believe in local resilience, direct ownership, mutual aid, and financial independence. Our mission is to:

- Deliver high-quality, accessible firewood and community goods.
- Support rural culture through economic sovereignty.
- Operate transparently through a values-aligned cooperative model.
- Build long-term treasury resilience via dual-currency systems (cash + Bitcoin).

## Project Goals (Phase I: 2025–2026)

- Launch first kiosk with mural-based cultural branding.
- Develop full production and retail system for firewood and candles.
- Educate community through content, documentation, and public action.
- Build legal, accounting, and governance infrastructure for cooperative transition.
- Deploy profits into The Northern Warmth Initiative and a sovereign treasury model.

## Governance Model

### Key Principles
- **Financial Independence Day (FID):** A defined threshold where leaders step back from pay and shift to unpaid advisory roles.
- **Advisor & Steward Council:** A body of trusted former leaders with limited oversight powers rooted in values enforcement.
- **Cooperative Transition:** Operational control and surplus distribution shifts to members starting in Year 10.
- **Profit Allocation:** 20% to community programs, 15% to site hosts, 10% to cash reserves, 40% to Bitcoin reserves, and 15% to owner bonuses (held in BTC).

## Final Note: The Line Drawn

> “Lead me, follow me, or get out of my way.” – *Thomas Paine*

This project—**Northern Michigan Firewood Company**—is not a business in the traditional sense. It is a declaration. Of sovereignty. Of dignity. Of resistance to systems that commodify communities, strip meaning from labor, and profit off disconnection.

The initial planning phase is now complete. What comes next will require structure, legal grounding, and financial clarity. That means:

- **Contacting legal clinics** to ensure the cooperative and FID models are watertight.  
- **Reaching out to accounting clinics** to finalize treasury protocols, reserve caps, and Bitcoin-based forecasting.  
- **Engaging political offices and representatives** not to beg for support, but to inform them—clearly—what we’re building, and what it stands for.  
- **Educating those who find this work**—so they can understand the vision, question it honestly, and decide for themselves if they belong inside it.

This next phase is about translation: turning vision into law, code, capital, and coordination. But it cannot be done alone.

### One Person Cannot Carry This

No matter how clear the vision or how bold the roadmap, the weight of resilience must be distributed—or it will collapse. This is not a plea. It’s structural reality.

I will never ask anyone to join me. I will not persuade you of values. That is not leadership—it is sales.  
You join because **you see something worth building**.  
Because you’re **done waiting for permission**.  
Because you want **something different, and maybe better**.

If that’s you, the door is open.  
If not, I bear you no ill will. But I won’t carry you, and I won’t slow down.

### This is the line.  
### Let’s build something that **doesn’t flinch**.
